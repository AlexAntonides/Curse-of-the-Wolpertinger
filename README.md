Description: <br>
Wolpertinger. A 3D Tower Defence other than others. In Wolpertinger, you have to take over the enemy base with your towers while defending your own. After each wave you are forced to take an action with each of your tower: upgrade (Costs gold) or move forward. 
You have to get as close to the enemy base to attack their base, although- the closer you get: The faster the enemies go.
